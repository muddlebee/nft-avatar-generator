This is a Next.js project with Polkadot API (PAPI) and KheopsKit wallet integration.

For any major code changes, follow the @ui.mdc rules to ensure best practices are maintained.

When implementing changes or fixes, always 
- check if the server is already running on the default port (3000) on our Windows OS using the command `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
- If the development server is not running on 3000, run `pnpm dev` to start the Next.js development server and wait for 5-10 seconds to ensure the server is running.
